            <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
            <p>
                HTML is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using
                elements and tags. These tags define headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and other content. HTML
                works together with CSS and JavaScript to create complete web applications. The html tag wraps all
                content, and head contains metadata like title and links to stylesheets. The body tag houses visible
                elements. Forms allow user input, and tables help structure data. HTML5 introduced semantic elements
                like header, nav, and footer for improved readability. Proper structuring improves SEO and
                accessibility.

            <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <p>
                CSS is used to style web pages and control their layout. It works by applying rules to HTML elements,
                altering their appearance with properties like color, font, margin, padding, and positioning. There are
                three ways to apply CSS: inline (within elements), internal inside style tags, and external (via linked
                .css files). Modern techniques include Flexbox and Grid for layout design. CSS allows responsive design
                using media queries. Animations and transitions enhance interactivity. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap
                streamline styling. Variables in CSS simplify theme customization. Well-structured CSS ensures a
                visually appealing and accessible website.

            <h2>JavaScript (JS)</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a dynamic programming language used for web interactivity. It runs in browsers, enabling
                tasks like form validation, animations, and API calls. JS follows an event-driven model where functions
                execute based on user interactions. It supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), manipulating data
                efficiently. ES6 introduced modern features like let, const, arrow functions, and promises. JavaScript
                interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), modifying elements dynamically. Frameworks like React,
                Angular, and Vue simplify development. Node.js allows JS to run on servers. Mastering JavaScript is
                crucial for full-stack development, enhancing user experiences and app functionality.

            HTML is the backbone of web pages, structuring content through elements that define headings, paragraphs, and
            sections. It begins with a declaration that identifies it as an HTML document, followed by metadata that
            influences display and functionality. The visible part of a webpage consists of text, images, links, and
            multimedia, all arranged using different structural components.
            Each element has attributes that modify its behavior, such as specifying image sources, linking documents,
            or adding interactivity. While HTML alone provides structure, it works alongside styling and scripting
            technologies to create dynamic and visually appealing pages. Its evolution has introduced features that
            enhance responsiveness, accessibility, and compatibility across devices.
            Modern web development relies on HTML's ability to integrate with other tools, enabling everything from
            simple documents to complex applications. The structure of a well-designed page improves user experience and
            readability, making it an essential skill for developers. Whether coding static sites or interactive
            platforms, understanding its principles ensures effective content presentation and functionality.
